== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I install this plugin without Beaver Builder? =

Yes, but it won't do anything. This plugin is an extension to [Beaver Builder](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/). Be aware that some modules require the paid version of Beaver Builder and some modules require Beaver Builder 2.0+.

= What about browsers? =

CB Custom Modules uses some modern CSS specs like Flexbox and animations. Modules will all work, but with older versions of IE you might see a less-refined version.

= Are these modules responsive? =

Yes. Some modules maintain their same behavior on mobile, but modules that rely on hover effects provide an experience tailored to touch screens.

= Is this plugin open source? =

[Yes](https://github.com/bacoords/cb-custom-modules). Feel free to use and adapt as needed. Or reach out to me with any feature requests.

= For the scout module, how do I make the page scroll to another part of the page? =

1. Find the row or element you want to scroll to, find the Advanced Settings tab, give that element a unique id such as *gallery*.
1. When you add your link to the module, the link field would need to be *#gallery*. The plugins do the rest.

The Beaver Builder team also has a great [breakdown](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/knowledge-base/smooth-scrolling-buttons-icons-and-links/) of this technique with screenshots.

= Can I get a custom module made for me or my client? =

Of course! Visit our [website](https://www.cbcustommodules.com/request-module) to learn more about requesting a custom module.

= Does CB Custom Modules work with Beaver Themer? =

Yes! Most modules have Beaver Field Connections where appropriate.
