Uploaded files arrive in a sub-folder inside your woocommerce folder on the same server hosting your website. Your hosting provider may limit the maximum size of files that you can upload. Since your disk space on the server may be limited, you must regularly remove these uploaded files or you risk running out of space. 

2. Amazon Web Services S3
Uploaded files arrive in a bucket you control on Amazon Web Services S3. There is no limitation to the maximum file size. There is no limit to the total amount of storage space you consume. You can keep the files on Amazon S3 as long as you would like.
